## This my attempt to replicate the MT-DNN paper 
(this project is still at its early stages)

this is the paper  
[Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks for Natural Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11504)

I will just include 3 of the tasks 

 * single sentence classification
 * pairwise text classification
 * relevance ranking
