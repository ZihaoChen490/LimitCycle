A collection of the methods that we used to time series prediction when there is a periodic structure (limit cycle) with the noise dataset.
First, the Flourier orthogonal basis is not the basis of the L2(Rd) space. The space spaned by the Flourier basis is only a countable-many-dimensional subspace of L2. 
So, honestly speaking, this method is limited in learning the periodic functions on L2.
Besides, this method only worked for special functions whose Fourier coefficients converges quickly.
